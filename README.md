# Project Title
### Overview
This repository contains simulated data that mimics real-world trends observed in data analytics projects. The fields in the dataset represent typical user tracking metrics used by companies. Although the data is synthetic, it accurately reflects the patterns, associations, and distributions found in real-world data analysis.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a realistic dataset for practicing data preprocessing and modeling techniques. In a professional setting, data is seldom clean and requires significant preprocessing before it can be used effectively for analysis and modeling. This repository aims to simulate this real-world scenario.

### Dataset Description
Fields: The dataset includes fields commonly tracked by companies from their users.
Distributions: Data distributions are based on observed trends from real-world data analysis, ensuring that patterns are realistic and representative.

### Usage
Data Exploration: Use the dataset to explore common data preprocessing challenges such as missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

Data Cleaning: Practice cleaning techniques like imputation, normalization, and scaling to prepare the data for modeling.

Modeling: Apply machine learning algorithms or statistical techniques to analyze the dataset and derive insights.

### Repository Structure
data/: Directory containing the simulated dataset files.

notebooks/: Directory for Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing and analysis techniques.

scripts/: Directory for any scripts related to data processing or modeling.

README.md: Overview and instructions for using the repository.

### Getting Started
#### To get started with this project:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the notebooks directory to explore example notebooks on data preprocessing and modeling.
