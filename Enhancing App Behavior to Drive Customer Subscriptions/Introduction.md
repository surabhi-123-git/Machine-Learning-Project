# Introduction
In today's market, many companies have mobile apps that offer free products or services. The goal is to encourage users to upgrade to paid memberships. Examples of such upgrades include YouTube Red, Pandora Premium, Audible Subscription, and You Need a Budget. Since marketing costs money, it's important for these companies to identify which users to target with their promotions and offers.

### Market:
The target audience consists of users who have installed and used the company's free mobile app.

### Product:
Paid memberships provide enhanced versions of the free products, along with additional features. For example, YouTube Red allows users to continue listening to videos even when they leave the app.

## Goal of the Project:
The aim of the model is to predict which users are unlikely to subscribe to the paid membership. This way, companies can focus their marketing efforts on convincing these users to upgrade to paid memberships.

## Business Challenge

A company wants to offer a paid mobile app subscription that helps customers track all their finances in one place. To attract users, they provide a free version of the app with some key features unlocked.

The company wants you to identify which users are least likely to upgrade to the paid version. By doing this, they can target these users with additional offers to encourage them to subscribe. Since these offers are costly, the company wants to avoid giving them to users who are likely to subscribe without extra incentives.

## Data

As an employee of the company, you have access to detailed data on each customer's app behavior. This data includes:

- The date and time the app was installed.
- The specific features and screens the users interacted with within the app.
- Whether the user engaged with the financial mini-games available in the app.

The data only covers the user's first day of app usage. This is because users can enjoy a 24-hour free trial of the premium features, and the company aims to target them with new offers shortly after the trial period ends.
